BGA Replacement Machine

This device helps you repair and replace CPUs and chips by providing an open-source Bascom program. You can improve or upgrade the program as needed. A Proteus file is also included for viewing or modifying the PCB design. Note that the program is optimized for 50Hz mains electricity. If you use it with 60Hz mains electricity, make sure to reduce the initial timer count in the Bascom program accordingly.
